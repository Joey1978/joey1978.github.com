## Helping Students Count Tally Marks

The kids are learning how to count with tally marks.  Interestingly, I found a
kid's book in the children's section of the CSULB library about the base five
number system.  Until I read that book, I didn't think of tally marks being base
five, but they are.  Right now `2012-10-23T10:21:22-0700` the afternoon kids
came in and they are doing a group write about the Earth, water, and mountains.
I love the idea of writing collaberatively---why does it go away?  When you're
older it's just a game, but why can't we write like this?  I'm going to try it
with someone.
